WOMAN: For the second in our series about locally-run businesses, we meet Slmon Winridge, co-founder of the hugely-successful Winridge Forest Railway Park. Welcome, Simon. Now, perhaps you can begin by telling us a little bit about how it's all started.  

MAN: Well, during the 1970s, my wife, Liz and I had just acquired 80 acres of sheep farming land, and we decided to settle down and have children. Pretty soon we had a daughter, Sarah, and a son, Duncan. The place was wonderful for the kids: they particularly loved trains and gradually built up an enormous network of miniature railvay track. began to develop larger-scale models of locomotives but we didn't think anything more of it until Lwent on a trip to a theme parknear Binmingham and decided could do a much better job! So we set up a small one ourselves bas the miniature railway and we opened to the public for just a month that Q12 year 1984 in July-our driest month-because our children said they didn't want our guests to have a miserable wet visit. I dealt with Park business and Liz carried on with the farm work. It soon became clear that we were onto a winner. We began to extend the railway track and lay it among more interesting landscape by planting trees, which in turn attracted more wildlife, and by making cuttings through the rock. Nowadays, we're open all year round and we're pleased to say that Winridge is one of the most popular visitor attractions in the area with 50,000 visitors a year a million and a half people have been through our Q13 doors since we opened All these visitors mean we have had to expand our operation and it's now a truly family concern m near to retirement age so Lonly concern myself Q14 with looking after the mechanical side of keeping the trains going Liz now devotes all her energies to recruiting and supporting the large Q15 sguadron of workers, which keep the place running smoothly. We're really pleased that after some years away teaching Sarah has now returned Q16 re the vicitore aro kopt fod and watered, which keeps her pretty busy as you can imagine. Our son, Duncan has been a Q17 stalwart of the park for the last ten years, taking over from me in the area of construction and I'll say a little bit more about that in a moment and bis new wife, Judith has also joined the team in charge of retail. That's becoming a tremendous growth area for us a lot of people want to buy Souvenirs So have you finished your development of the site for the moment? Not at all! We're constantly looking for ways to offer more to our visitors The railway remains the central feature and there's now 1.2 kilometres of the line laid but we'd like to lay more. Because of the geology of the area our greatest problem is digging tunnels. But we're gradually overcoming that. We're also very pleased with a new installation of th arena rea. Again the problem is the geology we had to the mounds on the track for safety reasons. We wanted to nts. And the main attraction here the Formula 1 Kart. We've known fights to break out over who gets it! And then finally to our most recent development which is the landscaped
