### Section 1 

MAN: Greek Island Holldays, can l help you?  

WOMAN: Yes, I hope so. I have a friend who's just come back and she's from Corfu recommended some apartments in Arilas. She thought they might be on your list.  

MAN: Arlas, Arilas, let me see. Can you give me the names?  

WOMAN: Yes, the first's Rose Garden Apartments. I'd like to go with another friend in the last week of October.  

MAN: Well, we've got a lovely studio flat available at that time. I'm sure you'd enjoy the entertainment programme there too, with **Greek dancing** in the restaurant. 

WOMAN: And the cost for each of us?  

MAN: £219.   

WOMAN: That sounds very reasonable! l'm just jotting down some notes. Now the second one she mentioned was called Blue Bay.  

MAN: Blue Bay? Yes, in fact that's very popular and it has some special features.  

WOMAN: Really?  

MAN: The main attraction is the large swimming pool with salt water.  

WOMAN: Much healthier, l understand. 

MAN: That's right. And **it isn't far from the beach either-only 300 metres**, and only around half a kilometre to some shops, so you don't have to be too energetic.   

WOMAN: Is it much more expensive than the first one?  

MAN: Let me just check. I think at the time you want to go it's around £260-no £275 to be exact. 

WOMAN: Right, I've got that. Now there are just two more apartments to ask you about. Um, I can't read my own writing! Something to do with sun... Sunshine, is it? 

MAN: I think you meant **the Sunshade Apartments**. They're on a mountainside.  

WOMAN: Any special features? 

MAN: Yes, each room has its own sun terrace and there are shared barbecue facilities.

WOMAN: Sounds lovely! 

MAN: it is rather well-equipped. It also provides water sports it has its own beach. There are facilities for water-skiing.

WOMAN: Any kite surfing? My friend's quite keen.

MAN: Not at the hotel but I'm sure you'll find some in Arilas. There's also satellite TV in the apartments.

WOMAN: And how much is that one? 

MAN: £490 with two sharing.

WOMAN: You mean £245 each? 

MAN: I'm afraid not! Each person has to pay that amount and there must be at least  two in an apartment.

WOMAN: I don't think that would be withinn our budget, unfortunately. And the last one sounds a bit expensive too - the Grand!
