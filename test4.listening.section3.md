Hello, Kira, how are you? Fine thanks, Paul, how are you? Well, thanks. It's good to see you. It must be twelve months since you did our course? That's right. It's nice to come back and say hello. What course did you enrol in? Actually, went straight into third year Pharmacy. They credited me with two years, which probably made it more difficult for me. On the other hand, you were lucky to be granted credits. Is that why you chose the course? Yes. And, as ountry, I thought it Q21 would be easier if I studied something I already knew. didn't realise you went into third year. I thought you started in first year. No wonder it was so hard! And what do you think is one of the big differences between studying at a university here and studying in your country? Well, I've found it very difficult to write assignments, because I wasn't familiar with that aspect of the system here. The main problem is that the lecturers expect you to be critical. That made me feel really terrible. I thought "How can I possibly do it? How can I comment on someone else's research when they probably spent five years doing it?" I think a lot of people who come from countries have similar problems. But after while it easier for me. People expect you to have problems with the process of reading and writing but, in fact, it is more a question of Q22 towards academic study How was the content of the lectures? Was it easy for you? didn't really have many problems understanding lectures. The content was very similar to what I'd studied before. And what about the lecturers themselves? Are they essentially the same lecturers in your country? Well actually, no. Here they're much easier to approach After every lecture you can go and ask them something you didn't understand. you can Or make an appointment and talk to them about anything in the course. Maybe you found them different because you're a more mature student now, whereas when you were studying in your country you were younger and not so assertive Q23 Q24 No, I don't think that's the difference. Most of the students here do In my faculty, they all seem to make appointments usually to talk about something in the course that's worrying them, but sometimes something that might really interest them, something they might want to Q25 they're in. The must set aside certain times every week when available for students That's good to hear.
