TEST 4

### Section 1 

MAN: Greek Island Holldays, can l help you?  

WOMAN: Yes, I hope so. I have a friend who's just come back and she's from Corfu recommended some apartments in Arilas. She thought they might be on your list.  

MAN: Arlas, Arilas, let me see. Can you give me the names?  

WOMAN: Yes, the first's Rose Garden Apartments. I'd like to go with another friend in the last week of October.  

MAN: Well, we've got a lovely studio flat available at that time. I'm sure you'd enjoy the entertainment programme there too, with **Greek dancing** in the restaurant. 

WOMAN: And the cost for each of us?  

MAN: £219.   

WOMAN: That sounds very reasonable! l'm just jotting down some notes. Now the second one she mentioned was called Blue Bay.  

MAN: Blue Bay? Yes, in fact that's very popular and it has some special features.  

WOMAN: Really?  

MAN: The main attraction is the large swimming pool with salt water.  

WOMAN: Much healthier, l understand. 

MAN: That's right. And **it isn't far from the beach either-only 300 metres**, and only around half a kilometre to some shops, so you don't have to be too energetic.   

WOMAN: Is it much more expensive than the first one?  

MAN: Let me just check. I think at the time you want to go it's around £260-no £275 to be exact. 

WOMAN: Right, I've got that. Now there are just two more apartments to ask you about. Um, I can't read my own writing! Something to do with sun... Sunshine, is it? 

MAN: I think you meant **the Sunshade Apartments**. They're on a mountainside.  

WOMAN: Any special features? 

MAN: Yes, each room has its own sun terrace and there are shared barbecue facilities.

WOMAN: Sounds lovely! 

MAN: it is rather well-equipped. It also provides water sports it has its own beach. There are facilities for water-skiing.

WOMAN: Any kite surfing? My friend's quite keen.

MAN: Not at the hotel but I'm sure you'll find some in Arilas. There's also satellite TV in the apartments.

WOMAN: And how much is that one? 

MAN: £490 with two sharing.

WOMAN: You mean £245 each? 

MAN: I'm afraid not! Each person has to pay that amount and there must be at least  two in an apartment.

WOMAN: I don't think that would be withinn our budget, unfortunately. And the last one sounds a bit expensive too - the Grand!    

MAN: Actually it's quite reasonable. It's an older style house with Greek paintings in every room, and **a balcony** outside.  
WOMAN: Sounds nice. What are the views like?  

MAN: Well, **there are forests all around** and they hide a supermarket just down the road, so that's very useful for all your shopping needs. There's a disco in the area too.  

WOMAN: And the price?  

MAN: **£319 at that time**, but if you leave it till November it goes down by 40% 

WOMAN: Too late, I'm afraid. 

MAN: Well, why don't I send you a brochure with full details, Ms...?  

WOMAN: Nash. But don't worry about that. I'm coming to Upminster soon and l'll call and get one. I just wanted to get an idea first.  

MAN: Well, that's fine. We've got plenty here when you come.  

=====  
  
WOMAN: If you've got a minute, could I just check a couple of points about insurance? I got one policy through the post but I'd like to see if yours is better.  

MAN: Fine. What would you like to know?  

WOMAN: Well, the one I've got has benefits and then the maximum amount you can claim. Is that like yours?  

MAN: Yes, that's how most of them are.  

WOMAN: Well, the first thing is cancellation. If the holiday's cancelled on the policy I've got, you can claim £8,000.  

MAN: We can improve on that, Ms Nash. **For Greek lsland holidays, our maximum is £10,000**.  

WOMAN: That's good - of course our holiday won't even cost £1,000 together!  

MAN: It's still sensible to have good cover. Now, if you go to hospital, we allow £600.  

WOMAN: Yes, mine's similar.  

MAN: And **we also allow a relative to travel to your holiday resort**.   

WOMAN: My policy just says their representative will help you.  

MAN: You can see there's another difference there. And what happens if you don't get on the plane?  

WOMAN: Nothing, as far as I can see on this form.  

MAN: Don't you have **missed departure**?  

WOMAN: No, I'll just jot that down.  

MAN: We pay up to £1,000 for that, depending on the reason. And we're particularly generous about loss of personal belongings - up to £3,000, but not more than **£500 for a single item**.  

WOMAN: Then I'd better not take my laptop!  

MAN: Not unless you insure it separately.  

WOMAN: OK - thanks very much for your time - you've really been helpful. Can get back to you? Your name is?  

MAN: **Ben-LudloW. That's L-U-D-L-O-W**. I'm the Assistant Manager here. I'll give you my number. It's 081260 543216.  

WOMAN: But didn't I phone 081260 567294? That's what I've got on the paper.  

MAN: That's the main switchboard. I've given you my direct line. 

WOMAN: Right, thank you ...
