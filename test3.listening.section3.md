TEST 3 / Listening  
=======

### Section 3    
  
TUTOR: Ah Caroline... come on in. Sit down.  
  
CAROLINE: Thanks.  
  
TUTOR: So how's the dissertation planning going? 

CAROLINE: Well Dr Schulmann, I'm still having a lot of trouble deciding on a title. 

TUTOR: Well, that's perfectly normal at this stage. And this is what your tutorials will help you to do.  
  
CAROLINE: Right.   
  
TUTOR: What we'll do is jot down some points that might help you in your decision. First of all, you have chosen your general topic area, haven't you? 

CAROLINE: Yes, it's **the fishing industry**.  
  
TUTOR: Oh yes, that was one of the areas you mentioned. Now, what aspects of the course are you good at?  
  
CAROLINE: Well, **I think I'm coping wel with statistics**, and I'm never bored by it.  
  
TUTUR: Good. Anything else?   
  
CAROLINE: Well, I found computer modelling fascinating - I have no problem following what's being taught, whereas quite a few of my classmates find it difficult.  
  
TUTOR: Well, that's very good. Do you think these might be areas you could bring into your dissertation?  
  
CAROLINE: Oh yes, if possible. It's just that I'm having difficulty thinking how I can do that. You see I feel I don't have sufficient background information.   
  
TUTOR: I see. Well, do you take notes?   
  
CAROLINE: **I'm very weak at note-taking**. My teachers always used to say that.  
  
TUTOR: Well, I think you really need to work on these weaknesses before you go any further. 
  
CAROLINE: What do you suggest?   
  
=======  

TUTOR: Well, I can go through the possible strategies with you and let you decide where to go from there.  
  
CAROLINE: Okay, thanks. 

TUTOR: Well, some people find it helpful to organise peer-group discussions you know, each week a different person studies a different topic and shares it with the group. 

CAROLINE: Oh right.  

TUTOR: **It really helps build confidence**, you know, having to present something to others.   
  
CAROLINE: I can see that.   
  
TUTOR: **Ihe drawback is that everyone in the group seems to share the same ideas... they keep being repeated in all the dissertations**.  
  
CAROLINE: Okay.  
  
TUTOR: You could also try a service called 'Student Support'. It's designed to give you a structured programme over a number of weeks to develop your skills.  
  
CAROLINE: Sounds good.  

TUTOR: Yes, **unfortunately there are only a few places**. But it's worth looking into.   
  
CAROLINE: Yes, of course. I know I've got to work on my study skills. 

TUTOR: And then there are several study skills books you can consult.  
  
CAROLINE: Right.  
  
TUTOR: They'll be a good source of reference but **the problem is there are something general**.    
  
CAROLINE: Yes, that's what I've found.  
  
TUTOR: Other than that I would strongly advise quite simple ideas like using a card index.  
  
CAROLINE: Well, yes, I've never done that before.  
  
TUTOR: It's simple, but it really works because you have to get points down in a small space. Another thing I always advise is don't just take your notes and forget about them. **Read everything three times** - that'll really fix them in your mind.  
  
CAROLINE: Yes, I can see it'd take discipline but...  
  
TUTOR: Well, if you establish good study skills at this stage they'll be with you all your life.  
  
CAROLINE: Oh yes, completely agree. It's just that I don't seem to be able to discipline myself. I need to talk things over.  
  
TUTOR: Well, we'll be continuing these tutorials of course. Let's arrange next month's now. Let's see, I can see you virtually any time during the week starting 22nd January.  
  
CAROLINE: What about the 24th? I'm free in the afternoon. 

TUTOR: Sorry, I'm booked then. What about the following day?  
  
CAROLINE: Thursday? I can make the morning.  

TUTOR: Fine, **we'll go for the 25th then**.  

CAROLINE: That's great, thanks.
