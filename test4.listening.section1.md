TEST 4 / Listening

### Section 1  
  
WOMAN: Can l help you?  
  
MAN: Yes, I've just moved to this area with my wife and children and I'd like to know where we can all register with a doctor at a Health Centre.  
  
WOMAN: Okay. Well, there's **Doctor Green** at The Harvey Clinic. **We always recommend her for babies**, because she's very good with them and she runs a special clinic. 
  
MAN: Oh... actually my youngest child is five, so that wouldn't be any good for us.  

WOMAN: Right.  

MAN: Is there anywhere else I could try?  
  
WOMAN: Yes, the **Eshcol** Health Practice is the next one on my list.  
  
MAN: How do you spell that? E-S-H-C-O-L. And it's Doctor Fuller, who has space on his list. The clinic only opened a year ago, so the facilities are all very modern.  
  
WOMAN: That sounds good.  
  
MAN: And it's particularly good if you're busy during the day, because **they also do appointments in the evening**. They're closed on Saturday, though. The only other place on the list is the Health Centre on Shore Lane. You can register with Doctor **Gormley**, that's G-O-R-M-L-E-Y. He's new there, but the centre has a very good reputation.  
  
WOMAN: Oh yes, I think I know the road. That would be the best one. Thanks. Could you tell me, will all their services be free?  
  
MAN:
